## It's as easy as 1-2-3 to start sharing, or collaboratively editing, your OER content!

1. Run the setup wizard for the [GitSync Plugin](../../admin/plugins/git-sync) and follow the provided instructions.
2. Copy the URL for your Git repository when viewing or editing a page and setup the [Edit/View Page in Git Particle](../../admin/gantry/configurations/default/layout) in the Navigation area within the Layout tab.
3. If you would like, you can change the Creative Commons(CC) Attribution License displayed by the [CC License Particle](../../admin/gantry/configurations/default/layout) in the Footer area within the Layout tab.

Since your content is now available within a Git repository (i.e. [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)), collaborative authoring is also now possible, as shown below:
